# Current BitBurner Handoff

Last refreshed: 2026-11-11 09:45 PC clock, on the PC. Trimmed from 1,918 lines on 2026-11-10. Every
earlier note is unchanged in `docs/archive/state-2026-11-10/STATE-full.md`. Run 2's detailed check
entries are in `docs/check-log.md`.

> **Which session is this? (standing note, keep at the top.)** The BitBurner run is meant to be worked from a Claude
> **Code** session on the PC, in the Claude desktop app's Code tab, with the folder `C:\Users\kenne\BitBurner`. Such a
> session has a shell, git, `tools/game_terminal.py` and the scheduled task's tools. If you are a plain **chat** session
> (claude.ai or the desktop Chat tab, no shell or repo folder), do not try to run, debug or change the game or the
> scheduled task from here. Tell Ken plainly: "This is a chat session. For BitBurner work, open the Claude desktop app,
> go to the Code tab, and start a session in C:\Users\kenne\BitBurner." Then help only with questions that need no
> game access. The 2-hourly check is the scheduled task "BitBurner BN10 progress"; its runs appear in the Code tab
> sidebar, and "Run now" there starts one. (On 2026-11-06 a chat-side attempt to sort out the task led to an
> unrecorded install.)

## How to keep this file

This file is the handoff, not a log. Keep it to about a page. Each run of the 2-hourly task
replaces **Latest check** below, adds one row to the install table when it installs, and writes its
full entry at the top of `docs/check-log.md`. Ken sessions do the same: change a standing setting
here when it changes, and put the detail in the check log. When a note here stops being true, remove
it. Its record is in the check log or the archive.

## Objective and authority

**BN10 run 3**, entered 2026-11-11 about 10:20 by Ken (run 2's daemon went unattended at about 09:47; check log).
**Ken is hands-off for the whole run** (2026-11-11): every action in the game is ours, so an unexplained install or
purchase is a script fault to find, not Ken. Route (`run_target.json`): gang (NiteSec) → NiteSec augs → The Covenant
(hacking and combat 850, $75b) → Daedalus, one install once its rep banks favor 150 → The Red Pill → World Daemon.
Installs are approved up to readiness to complete BN10, each with a save backup first. Stop at the World Daemon or
any other reset, take a backup and notify Ken (`AGENTS.md`). Install timing is the agent's judgement. The install
advisor is one input to it.

Owned source files: SF 1.2, 2.1, 4.3, 5.3, 10.2, 15.1 (10.2 assumed from the 7th sleeve; confirm). Seven sleeves.

## Standing settings (live, nothing to undo at installs)

- **Gang objective is `auto`** (2026-11-10, commit 667d2ab). The gang earns NiteSec rep until it
  covers every aug NiteSec sells (`gangRepNeeded` in `augmentation_readiness.json`, 3.5m now), then
  switches to Money Laundering by itself. An install resets faction rep, so the gang goes back to
  reputation on its own. Live 09:21: all 12 on Money Laundering, about $50b/h, penalty 0.999.
- **Cloud buying by cycle phase** (2026-11-10, commit 085ffe8). Game-only `capital_policy.json`:
  `{"reserve":0,"homeRamTarget":262144,"homeDemandFloor":0.5,"cloudDemandFloor":0,"lateCloudDemandFloor":0.5,"earlyCycleHours":1.5}`.
  For 1.5h after an install, cloud RAM is bought freely to speed up the hacking rebuild. After that,
  cloud RAM is bought only while MCP's own jobs fill half of it, which in practice means none. Home
  RAM is bought only while the scripts that need home fill half of it (`homeDemandFloor`;
  `capital_status.json` `homeDemand`; commit below). Added 2026-11-10 after a $4.74t home upgrade at
  14:53 bought RAM that sat 0.23% used. `capital_status.json` `cyclePhase` shows the phase. Why: in cycle 7, cloud
  RAM tripled while hacking income stayed flat, because MCP uses 0.2% of it.
- **Late in each cycle the aug batch comes first** (2026-11-10). From 1.5h after an install
  (`lateCycleLimit` in `capital_logic.js`): nothing an install wipes is bought (cloud RAM, sleeve
  augs), and anything lasting (home RAM, sleeve memory, sleeves) is held to 1% of cash per purchase
  (`lateSpendFraction`). Home RAM also needs demand. The gang already qualifies: money mode buys only
  gear that pays back in 30 minutes; reputation mode buys rep the batch needs. Status files:
  `capital_status.json` `homeDemand`, `sleeve_buyer_status.json` `cyclePhase` and `limits`.
- **Gang planner** (merged 2026-11-09, 47b5559; `docs/gang-planner.md`). The advisor keeps a 4h
  minimum cycle for the gang faction (cap 12h). Ascension runs in either mode, at x1.5 and at most one
  per loop. Reputation mode uses the 0.80/0.90 wanted-penalty band.
- Share stays on (A/B recorded 2026-11-05).
- **Allocator project** (`docs/allocator-design.md`; Ken approved 2026-11-10): central valuation,
  each script still buys, one `own`/`shadow`/`valued`/`sweep`/`never` setting per purchase kind in
  `valuation_flags.json`. Step R0, the spending ledger, merged 2026-11-10 (bd6aa68):
  `metrics.py spend` reports spending per cycle and B1 (late spend outside the batch, % of late
  earnings: 88%, 70%, 50% over cycles 6-8). Step R1, the shadow allocator, merged 2026-11-10 16:40
  (245363b) and running: `allocator.js` (5.45GB) writes `spend_grants.json` and one line per purchase
  to `allocator_shadow_log.txt`; it buys nothing and every kind is `own`. It is judged over cycle 9
  (install 8 at 16:15) on S1-S5 in the design doc before R2 lets any kind obey it.

## Installs this run

| # | When (PC clock) | Bought | Installed after |
|---|---|---|---|

Run 2's 13 installs are in `docs/check-log.md`. Backups are `saves/bitburnerSave_pre-install<N>_BN10run3_<date>.json.gz`.

## Latest check

**2026-11-11 10:30 (Ken session): run 3 start.** Home 64GB, full at entry. Killed `mcp.js`, `mcp_xp.js` and `stack_manager.js`
(about 31GB; `stack_manager` idles until Formulas.exe anyway); `sleeve_crime_now.js` put all 7 sleeves on Shoplift;
`early_spread.js joesguns` rooted 23 servers and started 367 loop threads; `capital_bootstrap` handed over to
`capital_manager.js` (saving $47.8m for home RAM, then TOR and programs); started `faction_join.js` and `gang_create.js`.
Running: mcp_supervisor, crawler, steward, money, cct_watcher, capital_manager, faction_join, gang_create (2GB free).
Not running for lack of RAM: mcp.js, stack_manager, HUD, run_report, player controller, xp_filler, metrics_logger,
sleeve_controller.

## Next

1. As home grows (128GB+): kill the `scripts/weakenGrowHack.js` loops and `run startup.js` so MCP, the logger and
   `sleeve_controller` return. Move sleeves to Mug/Homicide for karma once their stats allow.
2. Gang at karma -54k (`gang_create.js` is running).
3. Find what destroyed run 2's daemon (check log 2026-11-11 09:47) before this run nears hacking 6000.

## Open questions

None.
